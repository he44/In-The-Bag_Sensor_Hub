☐ Research the infinite loops
    ☐ "Waiting for Hub_B..."
        ✔ find the line in .ino file @started(19-02-27 11:51) @done(19-02-27 12:20) @lasted(29m9s)
        ☐ add print statements before and after that code block @started(19-02-27 11:51)
        Observation:
            - it seems that all the print statements are from Hub A
            - fix: just need to disconnect TX/RX/ReSET from controller A and then connect them to controller B 
    ✔ "Waiting for Alarm..." @done(19-02-27 12:15)
        ✔ find the line in .ino file @started(19-02-27 11:53) @done(19-02-27 12:13) @lasted(20m26s)
        ✔ add print statements around that code block @done(19-02-27 12:13)
        Note:
            the most probable reason for this infinite loop is still FLAG (B-A commnucation)
            checkModeChange() can be toggled by the physical swtich on hub board. We can easily control what value it returns
            However, toggling that will lead hub into "config mode", which is not what we want
        Conclusion:
            for the hub to work, it must pass this while loop by FLAG == HIGH
        ☐ Check why the if statement in line 94 in Hub_B.ino didn't evaulate to True
            Code:
                DS3231 Clock;
                Clock.checkIfAlarm(1)
